# CSAutoreport

A simple script to automate mass reporting in Counter-Strike 2 using a bug in the reporting menu. I have sent it to the development team; maybe they will fix it at some point.


## Requirements

* To run this script, you need to have Python installed and Pip to install the libraries. It should work well with any relatively recent version of Python.

* You need to run these commands to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
  pip install colorama
```

```bash
  pip install pyautogui
```

```bash
  pip install keyboard
```
